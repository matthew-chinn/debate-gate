README

An application to help facilitate debates. Much still needs to be done.

TODO:

Front-end:
* Welcome/home page display featured debates
* Categories for debates (hashtags?)
* get rid of individual argument show pages in favor or single scroll debate
* Views under argument controller will be popups for counter/supporter args
* Make homepage something else, not login screen
* mobile style

Back-end:
* Favorite/like/dislike button for arguments
* Order arguments by Newest/Oldest/Favorited #
* Character limit for arguments? 
* Mark a counter/supporting argument as a new debate
